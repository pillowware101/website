        <h1>Ninja Search is a search engine for the web</h1>
        <p>Ninja Search was made to give you speedy search results(results may not be speedy now because our server is not completely finished being setup yet).</p>
        <p><br>We do not track your browsing history or sell your browsing data to advertisers.</p>
        <p><br>We use only Raspberry Pis for our server so you can give the Raspberry Pi Foundation that we can bring you<br></p>
        <p>quality search results. You can also thank the author of "The Google Story", David A. Vise because it was his book<br></p>
        <p>that gave me the idea to build this search engine to give search results to the world.</p>
